Hello Guys, I am Paulo Martins, also known as "PV"

I started my programmer's life around the 2000s, with very simple ActionScript scripts for Adobe Flash.

From then, it has been a rollercoaster of emotions, with me ending up in Mechanical Engineering.

Yes, I have a PhD in Acoustics and Vibration, so this is my main focus with this GitHub.

I hope you guys like it!
